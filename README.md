# Neural Networks for Learning

This project was created as a recreational and educational exercise to learn about neural networks and experiment with their implementation from scratch in Python.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding the inner workings of neural networks, including how they are structured, trained, and used for predictions. All code was written for learning purposes, with a focus on clarity and experimentation rather than production-level performance.

## Project Structure

- `neural.py` and `train.py`-> First try of implementing the MLPs neural Networks
- `neural2.py`: Second and final implementation of AI
- `train2.py`: A  file to train AIs using the neural2.py code and save the trained model as `neural_network.pkl` using the pickle library
- `test.py`: A file to load and use the previously trained models

## Features

- Manual implementation of neural network layers, weights, and biases.
- Custom training loops and backpropagation logic.
- Simple dataset handling for experimentation.
- Serialization of trained models for reuse.
- Entirely built without deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch â€” fully written from scratch.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Only standard libraries (`math`, `pickle`, `copy`, `numpy`).
